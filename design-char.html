                    Heroes of the Storm - that's how dedicated to not playing Blizzard games he is. He still signed up for
                    the Overwatch beta. I wonder how that will work out for him?

                    This Twitch streamer doesn't like Blizzard games either. He prefers to stream H1Z1 and get into arguments about whether
                    China is number one. He does have two hundred followers though, and a contact at Blizzard. He wants to
                    get into the Overwatch beta early so he can get a headstart on the other streamers. How will things work
                    out for him?
