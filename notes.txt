TODO

1. Keep working on changing "Go for a walk" to being adventures. Four-Five adventures should be enough, as long as they all can't happen in one game.
2. Change social media posts to be the equivalent of a magic find run - possible money, possible salt, possible beta. Needs a lot of small, one-off events. Time should be 10 seconds maybe.
3. Work + Buy Items should be reasonable but risky strategy. Best items from adventures and randomed from MF, all items bought by money (other than simple ones) should have element of risk.
4. Possibly change briefcase drop
5. On battle screen exit UNBIND EVERYTHING

56) tassadar ending -> random event, salt plague hits world, record levels of saltiness, you absorb it all to save everyone
59) if overwatch preorder fails you can get lost and not know how to get into beta
60) no time decrement
61) tips on home screen

68) Blizz CM bonus game
70) New items: [overwatch char's] cookbook, provides basic food to help
71) Add twitch streaming as social activity. Can be recipient of donations or provider of them in exchange for items / beta%. Eg maybe seagull donation lands you "lucky gull" item?
