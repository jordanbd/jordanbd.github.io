FROM IPHONE

Overpowered items should be hard to come by, or require planning.
Social media should be wildcard / "magic find run."
Add twitch streaming as social activity. Can be recipient of donations or provider of them in exchange for items / beta%. Eg maybe seagull donation lands you "lucky gull" item?
